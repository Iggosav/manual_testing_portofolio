# Testing section
## 1.1 Test Planning
The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the Huse module from the lenjeriidelux-pucioasa application. 

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.

#### 1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated

* Software Developer - Nicu Apetrei 
* Product Owner	     - Sandra Alexei  
* Project Manager    - Delia Pruteanu 
* QA Engineer        - Irina Gosav    
* Senior QA Engineer - Radu Molocea

#### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined
* Business documentation should be available.
* Functional specifications are defined
* Roles and responsibilities have been established.
* The test plan has been created.
* Initial project risks were identified and defined.


#### 1.1.3 Exit criteria defined
* All tests from the plan have been completed.
* Number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or they have low priority
* All bugs were identified, documented, and resolved if was possible.
* Created and reviewed test reports and documentation.
* Business documentation was covered and met.
* The established deadline was reached.


#### 1.1.4 Test scope
* **Tests in scope:** All the feature of Huse module which were defined in software requirement specifications need to be tested: functional testing and GUI testing. Successfully obtaining a product purchase by completing the product selection and to add them to the cart and add vouchers if the case.
* **Tests not in scope:** Non-functional testing encompasses performance, security, and compatibility testing;Payment steps are not tested;Testing on specific hardware configurations or devices;Testing functionalities that refer to other types of account options or products (except: “Huse”);Automated testing is not covered.


#### 1.1.5 Risks detected

**Project risks:**
  
* *Resource Constraints:* Insufficient skilled personnel, such as developers, testers, or subject matter experts, could hinder project progress and quality.
* *Budget Overruns:* Exceeding the allocated budget due to incorrect cost estimations, unforeseen expenses, or insufficient resources allocation.
* *Communication Challenges:* Inadequate communication and coordination among project stakeholders, including testers, the development team, and company representatives, may result in misunderstandings, misalignment, and decision-making delays.
* *Scope limitation:* Frequent changes in project scope without thorough assessment and impact analysis might disrupt project schedules, resource allocation, and deliverables.
  
**Product risks:**
  
* *Incomplete or Inaccurate Content:* Presence of inaccuracies, incomplete details, or outdated content on the website could adversely affect the overall user experience.
* *Security Vulnerability:* Existence of vulnerabilities within the application might expose user data, compromising the platform’s security and trust.
* *Performance Challenges:* Possibility of delays in processing user actions, slow page loading times, or inadequate performance during periods of high traffic.
* *Compatibility Issues:* Potential compatibility conflicts with major web browsers, operating systems, or devices may cause usability challenges for certain users.
* *Functional Deficiencies:* Risk that implemented functionalities may not fully meet the expected requirements, potentially resulting in user dissatisfaction or negative experiences.

#### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria
The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.

## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

Regular tests status reports will be generated to reflect testing progress and identify new project risk for mitigation.

## 1.3 Test Analysis
The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the Dependents module. The following test conditions were found:
